# Chapter 11 - Alexandria

## Module Introduction

The API we are going to build is called Alexandria, a complete e-commerce platform that sells books.

We've decided to build a web API with Rails 5 that will be used by a front-end JavaScript SPA (Single-Page Application) and an iOS mobile application - shared backend.

At first, this API won't be following all REST constraints, therefore it cannot be considered "RESTful". That will be covered more thoroughly in Module 3.
