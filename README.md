  Master Ruby Web APIs
</h3>

## About this Project :rocket:

This is a summary of the book [Master Ruby Web APIs](https://devblast.com/r/master-ruby-web-apis/toc), which I didn't write, I have created to learn core Web APIs concepts, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails.

The book itself is divide in 3 modules:

- The first module focus more on core Web APIs concepts using [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/).

- The second one applies the concepts learned on the past module to create Web APIs using Ruby on Rails.

- I'm not sure what the third and last module will cover yet, but I'll update this once I'm done with the second module.

I've also added links to resources that I've found helpful explaining concepts I had a difficult time understanding in some of the chapters' summary.

## Why you should read this book?

This a well balanced book and I've found it contains the right amount of theory and practice sample codes. If you know some Ruby (beginner to intermediate) and are looking to strengthening your knowledge on Ruby or Ruby on Rails or Web APIs, this is the book for you!
